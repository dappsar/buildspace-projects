# Build an Ethereum dApp

## Introduction

A website that I'll be calling the WavePortal. It'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract.

It was developed following the steps in [buildspace.so](https://buildspace.so/).

## Tech Stack

* Visual Studio Code
* nvm / nodejs / npm / npx
* Solidity
* Metamask
* HardHat
* Reactjs
* QuickNode
* Replit: It is a browser-based IDE that lets us easily build web apps and deploy them all from the browser. It is super legit. Instead of having to set up a full local environment and write commands to deploy, it's all just given to us.


## Environment Setting

* [Install nodeJs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
* Install dependencies (npm i)
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

## Live demo

https://waveportal-starter-project.dappsar.repl.co

## Some Commands

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm hardhat compile
npx hardhat test or REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
